# Advent of Code 2020 - Rust
My Rust solutions to [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) problems. Not much to see here yet but let's go have some fun!

My style prioritises being easy to follow, understand and reason about.  So you'll typically see a lot _more_ code here than with some other people's solutions - this isn't the place to come to learn how to write really tight, concise Rust that does a lot in few lines.  With the occasional exception, I generally don't sacrifice much in the way of performance, though.
